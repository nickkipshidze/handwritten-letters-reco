# Handwritten Georgian letters recognition

A model to recognize all 33 letters in the Georgian alphabet, using PyTorch.

The training and testing dataset is saved as `dataset.joblib`.

I have also made a YouTube video on this! I made it in Georgian though, if you speak Georgian you might find it interesting: https://youtu.be/XKwoWtOaptE
